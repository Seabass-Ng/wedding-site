# Wedding Site

## Why make your own site instead of making one from The Knot or Zola?

As a frontend engineer, I occasionally build out projects to learn what's new in the industry. If I do this from time to time, why not build a site I need?

## What is used here?

The site is built on top of next.js. I use material-ui (still debating if I should drop this for mdbootstrap since they have masonry, but lack of styled components support) as the main component library. I have styled components for css. The main programming language is typescript.

I originally started with gatsby.js, but I didn't like how they handled background images and working on it felt like working with wordpress.

## What have I learned here?

This is probably the first production typescript project I have worked with. Most places I have worked at didn't bother with much type checking and if they did, they used flow. I have come to really like using Typescript. It's been a while since I have worked a compile time checking language and VSCode seems to work better with it in terms syntatical checking. I also haven't kept up with next.js or styled components for a while, so it was nice to see some of the new features they have. I also got to play around with material-ui and gatsby to see what they're all about. I have been hearing about them for some time now and got to look at them. Even though I didn't get to host it on AWS (Custom domain routing is really expensive), I got to mess with it for a little bit.
